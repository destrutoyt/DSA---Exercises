DIVIDE & CONQUER EXPLANATION:
It is an effective approach for managing challenges that divides a major problem into smaller, easier-to-manage subproblems. The solution to the main problem is obtained by combining the final solutions from ultiple individually solved sub-problems.

KEYS:
- DIVIDE: The first step is to divide the primary problem into smaller sub-issues. A key characteristic of this approach is its recurse nature, which allows each sub-problem to be further divided down into smaller sub-problems unitl it reaches a base case that is easy to solve

- CONQUER: Each subproblem is tackle separately as soon as it is small enough. Recursive use of the divide-and-conquer approach or a brute-force approach can be utilized to do this.

- MERGE: To solve the primary problem, the sub-problems' answers must be merged in the last stage. It is up to the particular problem being solved and how this combination is applied.
